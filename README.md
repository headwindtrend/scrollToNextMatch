# scrollToNextMatch
Use your mouse wheel to cycle through all the matches in Sublime Text 3. Plus, an alternate `find_under` (so as `find_under_prev`) command which adopts hyphen and `#` as part of a "word"; as well as a smart_match command which treats single-quote, double-quote, and backtick as the same in matching, and neglects any mismatch due to space difference.
